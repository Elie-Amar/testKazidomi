# Small assignment from Kazidomi:
1) make a screen with Kazidomi's logo
2) have few articles below (I made 2 types of display)
3) when the users leaves the app (background or kills it), send a push notification to make him come back (I've setup 5 seconds for testing conveniences).

NB: Notification works on Android only
